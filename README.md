# Data Professional Survey Breakdown 📊

## Project Overview
This project analyzes survey data from data professionals using **Power BI**.  
The goal is to understand trends in roles, salaries, skills, and overall job satisfaction in the data field.

I prepared and cleaned the raw data, then built an **interactive Power BI dashboard** that allows users to explore and compare insights across different dimensions.
